# HOW TO IMPROVE YOUR ART
A guide for drastically improving your art 

## **INTRODUCTION TO ART**
There are countless definitions of art, but for me, it is the creative expression of one’s self. It may be in the form of drawings, paintings, music, sculptures, poetry, and etc. But we will be focusing on how to draw.

> NOTE: I AM NOT AN EXPERT BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY. However, I am willing to share with you what I’ve learned in my 11 year process of drawing.

## Fundamentals of Art
The Fundamentals of Art are the building blocks in artworks. There are many Fundamentals of Art that I am happy to teach you, but here are the 10 important principles of drawing:
1. Basic Shapes
2. Form
3. Composition
4. Texture
5. Lines
6. Anatomy
7. Proportions
8. Color Theory
9. Perspective
10. Highlights and Shadows

### 1. Basic Shapes
![Basic Shapes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99783855/155145793-ca59c4f3-ddb2-4c57-829d-f1c5b46e2b29.jpg)

The world is made up of a variety of shapes. Some may agree with this to some extent, but others may object that there are objects with irregular shapes. That is correct, but it is not the end of the world. If you're trying to draw a complicated object, such as a bottle, an electric fan, or something else, you'll need to break it down into simple shapes to make it easier to draw. The head of an electric fan, for example, has a circular shape. So, when you first sketch a fan, draw a circle to make it look like a fan.

### 2. Form

Following the discussion of basic shapes, we will move on to form. To put it simply, it is what gives a shape or object a 3D appearance. Form defines anything with volume, and it adds depth and realism to your drawing. When you draw a circle, you can transform it into a sphere by adding form to it.

### 3. Composition
![Composition](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99783855/155145947-4dc98e2e-110e-4db6-8f1b-d0a8b61d1c61.jpg)

Okay, this may seem intimidating, but don’t worry, it is not that bad at all. Composition by definition means “to put together.” It is the combination of all the fundamentals of art, which is now considered the finished piece. Composition is defined by size, angle, perspective, and attention to the foreground/background objects of your drawing.

### 4. Texture
![Texture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99783855/155146023-1a3bfdcc-4786-467c-ae83-275cbe766bc0.jpg)

Texture is the feel, appearance, or consistency of a surface or object, in case you didn't already know. Rocks have a rough texture, whereas silk has a smooth texture, wood is hard, whereas pillows are soft, and so on. Texturing an object in a drawing is actually quite difficult; however, one simple trick for adding texture is to use shading techniques.

### 5. Lines
![Lines](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99783855/155146107-e9fd3039-1924-47e1-8557-2e5a6ece0251.jpg)

It is self-explanatory, but for those who are unfamiliar, lines are what make your drawing stand out and have shape. It can vary in thickness, color, length, consistency, and other factors. When outlining a drawing, don't rush through it; instead, take your time to ensure cleanliness and consistency. Make the outline of the main object or character thicker to help your drawings stand out from the background.

### 6. Anatomy
![Anatomy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99783855/155146160-b34c694c-a816-49e4-8ba0-9792d0c47ca0.jpg)

Anatomy has long been regarded as one of the most difficult subjects for many artists to fully grasp. However, in order to fully comprehend it, you must first understand the human body, as this will come in handy when drawing character designs, comics, portraits, and so on. Here are the key differences between male and female anatomy: men's torsos are typically larger than female torsos, men's shoulders are wider than women's shoulders, women's waists are smaller than men, women's hips are wider than men, and men are generally larger than women. And the following are the key similarities between male and female anatomy: the arms usually bend at the stomach and the wrists end up near the hip, and the average person stands 7 to 7.5 heads tall.

### 7. Proportions
![Proportions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99783855/155146191-2cce41c6-f638-4490-8443-9226f715f885.jpg)

Consider a normal human being on a flat field with a 10-foot dog beside him. It wouldn't make sense, would it? That is why proportions are significant; they ensure that the ratios of two different or identical objects are equivalent. The proportions are clearly off in this scenario, because the dog is clearly larger than the diminutive human. However, if proportions are present, it will appear normal.

### 8. Color Theory
![Color Theory](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99783855/155146228-caf5f259-f786-490b-8187-cbc0cccdb74d.jpeg)

We are all familiar with the color wheel, which includes primary, secondary, and tertiary colors. Color theory is used in art to explain how humans perceive color. It also includes the messages that colors communicate, as well as the methods used to replicate color. Having a good understanding of color theory improves your art because it can add mood to your drawings, it gives the readers an understanding of what your drawing is about, and it supports the drawing's theme.

### 9. Perspective
![Perspective](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99783855/155146275-68fa4a6b-15e1-42cf-8f44-9b5fe991e464.jpg)

You've probably heard the term "perspective" and are familiar with it, and the same is true for art. The representation of three-dimensional objects or space in two-dimensional artworks is known as perspective. In a drawing or painting, it is also what the person sees or their point of view. One-point perspective, two-point perspective, three-point perspective, and the fisheye perspective are the most common types of perspective in art.

### 10. Highlights and Shadows
![Highlights and Shadows](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99783855/155146339-7f737430-9d70-4cdd-bd56-4c7641263435.jpg)

Highlights are caused by light striking and reflecting an object or a person, whereas shadows are caused by a lack of light striking a specific area of an object or a person. And these two fall under the Values category, which defines how light or dark a given color or hue can be. A light source is required in order to create highlights and shadows in your drawing. If you have a sphere and the light source is at the top-right, the highlights must also be at the top-right, and it will gradually get darker as it moves towards the lower-left.
